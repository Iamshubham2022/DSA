An array A rotated by x positions results in an array B 
of the same length such that A[i] == B[(i+x) % A.length],

A[i]=B[(iâˆ’x+n)%n] right to left  k=k%n; for over flow
A[i] == B[(i+x) % n] left to right;

where % is the modulo operation.

*max_element(nums.begin(),nums.end());
accumulation(nums.begiin(),nums.end(),0);

1e10====int
long long >=1e10

if i want to find out a longest array with sum k,and that array carries +ve,-ve,0 then 
i will go for thee sulotion by using preffix sum , k = sum of x ele - sum of (x-k) ele;
by using hashmap data-structure;

but for only positive i will go with another solution

next_permutation

if you want to find out monotonically then use stack;

diffrence array technique------
arr ={1,2,3,4,5,2,3,5,7}
q=[[1,2,1],[1,5,-1],[2,5,8]]
